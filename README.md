# Silly web projects
In this repository you'll find some simple web projects taken from [https://roadmap.sh/](https://roadmap.sh/). Here a brief description of each:
- `Restricted text area`: Create a textarea with live character count and a max character limit ([restricted-textarea](https://roadmap.sh/projects/restricted-textarea))
- `Accordion`: Create an accordion component that displays a list of questions or headings ([accordion](https://roadmap.sh/projects/accordion))
- [`Tabs`](https://roadmap.sh/projects/simple-tabs): Create a simple page with 4 tabs, one default. When the user clicks on another tab, the content of the current tab will be hidden, and the content of the selected tab will be displayed.
